# Flow Card DPS vs Modbus Mapping

This document compares the runtime implementation status of flow cards in:

- `org.hhi.adlar-heatpump` (DPS / Tuya)
- `org.hhi.adlar-heatpump-modbus` (Modbus)

The `.homeycompose/flow` catalog is currently the same in both repos. The main difference is runtime wiring.

## Legend

- `helper`: registered in app bootstrap via `flow-helpers.ts`
- `custom`: registered directly in `app.ts`
- `manager`: registered by `FlowCardManagerService`
- `direct`: directly fired by a service or device implementation
- `compose only`: flow card JSON exists, but no runtime registration path was found
- `skipped`: registration code exists, but required service is not injected in the current Modbus app
- `alias gap`: runtime registration exists, but it points to a DPS compatibility capability that the Modbus driver does not populate or listen to
- `not wired`: code tries to use a trigger path, but the current Modbus implementation does not provide the required device hook
- `ok`: current Modbus runtime is functionally present
- `missing helper bootstrap`: the DPS app registers the shared helper cards from `app.ts`, the Modbus app does not
- `missing app custom listener`: a DPS custom `app.ts` registration path is absent in Modbus
- `missing app trigger listener`: the DPS app registers a `getDeviceTriggerCard(...).registerRunListener(...)` path that Modbus does not
- `missing device trigger source`: no Modbus-side code currently detects and fires the trigger
- `missing device trigger hook`: a service expects `device.triggerFlowCard(...)` or `RollingCOPCalculator.config.device`, but Modbus does not provide it
- `missing capability listener`: the target capability exists or could exist, but Modbus has no write listener for it
- `service not injected`: runtime registration depends on a service that Modbus does not currently pass into `FlowCardManagerService`
- `alias mismatch`: the shared flow logic targets DPS capability ids while Modbus uses different ids
- `no runtime registration`: the compose JSON exists, but neither repo currently registers a runtime handler
- `no Modbus equivalent`: no clear Modbus-side capability or command exists yet

## Main Differences

- The DPS app initializes `registerSimpleActions()`, `registerSimpleConditions()`, temperature/pulse trigger helpers, and several custom calculator and trigger listeners from `app.ts`.
- The Modbus app `app.ts` does not initialize `flow-helpers.ts` and does not register the custom calculator or trigger listeners that the DPS app registers in `app.ts`.
- The Modbus `FlowCardManagerService` does register the action-based condition cards, external-data cards, performance report card, and pricing/adaptive cards.
- The Modbus `ServiceCoordinator` does not inject `BuildingInsightsService` into `FlowCardManagerService`, so the related action and condition cards are skipped.
- The Modbus driver uses several different capability ids than the DPS app. That creates multiple `alias gap` cases in action-based conditions.
- The Modbus device does not expose the DPS-style `triggerFlowCard()` helper, and `RollingCOPCalculator` is created without a device trigger hook. That leaves several trigger cards effectively unwired.

## Device Scope Note

Registration from `app.ts` is app-wide, but that does not automatically make a flow card cross-device or unscoped.

- For actions and conditions, the listener is registered once, but execution is still per selected device because Homey passes `args.device`.
- For device triggers, the runtime stays device-scoped when code uses `getDeviceTriggerCard(...)` and later calls `.trigger(device, tokens, state)` with the originating device.
- The important rule is: shared registration may live in `app.ts`, but mutable state and actual measurements should remain on the device or device-owned services.

## Short Summary

- Shared Modbus runtime coverage is strongest for:
  - external-data actions
  - pricing and adaptive conditions/triggers
  - performance report cards
  - a subset of direct service triggers
- The biggest Modbus gaps are:
  - all DPS helper-based simple actions and simple conditions: `missing helper bootstrap`
  - DPS custom app-level calculator and condition cards: `missing app custom listener`
  - DPS trigger cards for temperatures, pulse steps, fault, mode changes, and efficiency alerts: `missing app trigger listener` and/or `missing device trigger source`
  - Building Insights cards: `service not injected`
  - COP trend / daily COP / monthly COP / daily consumption triggers: `missing device trigger hook`
